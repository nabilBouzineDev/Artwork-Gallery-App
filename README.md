 A simple app to practice previous google codelabs with concepts likes: _**Creating a low-fidelity prototype**_, _**basic compose layouts**_ and **_buttons click behavior_**.

 # Resources
 The main resource to get started with this project:
   
   - [Lab: Create an Art Space app](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-art-space)

# Prerequisites
  It's recommended to have these _**prerequisites**_ for completing this project:

   1. Ability to create and run a project in Android Studio.
   2. Experience with Kotlin syntax, which includes Boolean and when expressions.
   3. Ability to apply basic Jetpack Compose concepts, such as the use of state with MutableState object.
   4. Experience with composable functions, which includes Text, Image, and Button composables.

# Low-Fi

  - I made a simple model that provides me a basic idea of what the app looks like. Then, I divide this drawing into sections to identify which **_composables_** I'll use.

  - Later on, I design the UI and a prototype on how the app will behave using **_Figma_**.

  - Finally, I make the button click logic and layout of the app using **_Kotlin_** and **_Jetpack Compose_** library.
